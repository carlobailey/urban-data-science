## Urban Data Science & Analytics at CCNY

Resources for urban research that explore, architecture, urbanism, and authoritative forces that shape the built environment at CCNY CUNY.

------

### Learning Objectives
This site is intended to help students:
- Learn how to download, explore and visualize opensource urban data
- Gain fluency with mapping and other data visualization techniques
- Ask basic questions of data and how to interpret results

### Technology
Resources are focused around:
- Python & Jupyter Notebooks – for coding
- Pandas - for data analytics
- Geopandas – for spatial analytics
- Kepler GL - for mapping
- Tableau - for general data visaulization and analysis


### Computing Resources
Students are assumed to have access to a personal computer, ideally a laptop, to follow along with the below tutorials and in-class workshops. You will need to download and install both [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) in order to complete tutorials (I recommend installing Python through the [Microsoft Store](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-the-microsoft-store) if using Windows and installing via [Homebrew](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-homebrew) if using Macs). Please contact the instructor directly with any issues or questions related to hardware/software.

During the semester, students are encouraged to scour the internet for other opensource resources urban analytics. A couple of good ones:
- [Methods in Spatial Research](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/methods-in-spatial-research-sp2020), from GSAPP's Center for Spatial Research. A deep dive into using QGis.
- [Urban Data Science](https://github.com/gboeing/urban-data-science), from UC Berkley. For those interested in more advanced applications.
