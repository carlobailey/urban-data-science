## Downloading and mapping PLUTO data with Tableau

What is PLUTO data? PLUTO stands for Primary Land use Tax lot Output and is a rich dataset provided by the planning department of New York City. It has information on a properties square-footage, retail space, number of residential units, FAR, etc. In this tutorial we will download PLUTO data from the [NYC Planning Data portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page) and visualize it in Tableau.


### Step 1: downloading PLUTO data
We will begin by heading to the NYC Planning website to get the [PLUTO data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page). Click the download button under version **Release 20v6** â€“ note: next to download is a data dictionary, this provides information as what each of the columns in the PLUTO dataset indicate. For example, according to the data dictionary *ResArea* is the total residential floor area for a property. It is worth checking the data dictionary to get an understanding of the information available for any future analysis you do with this data, for the purposes of this tutorial we will mostly ignore it. Once your download is complete, unzip the folder in a suitable location.


### Step 2: downloading US zip code data
For the purposes of this example, we will visualize the PLUTO data at zip code level. To do this we will need zip code geometries. Use [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16b3l5_JwUNwr4T9nqoBjKLB30miB6i2-/view?usp=sharing) to download zip codes for the entire US (the file is ~1.4GB).


### Step 3: Visualization in Tableau
